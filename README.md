## Device Operation

This station allows for multiple games.  

### lvl 0-words: "The Words Troll" or Written English

####Theory
The voice says "Show me the word {the}" and the player places that card on the RFID reader to score a point.  

#### Game
The player is trying to mess things up for a words troll who is terrorising a once beloved forum.  
The player places the "I'm calling your shananigins" on the tongue, and the narrator says "you're being unkind and you should be respectful to others" 
but the troll says "I don't care about others, and there's nothing you can do about it!"

The words troll says some negative things and then eats some tree tops... 
This makes it so certain words will taste very bad to him!
The narrator tells the player which words will taste the worst to the troll, 
and when the player places the correct word on the toung, the words troll yells "YUCKIE!!!!" and variations.  


### lvl 0-numbers: "Math Gremlin" or Learn Numbers


#### Theory
The voice indicates which card to use, and the player places it on the tongue.  

#### Game
Same as words troll pretty much.  
The math gremlin is very mean and bossy.  
He demands to eat any number except 1 specific number.  
The narrator says "you know, just give him that number, maybe he'll just go away."


### lvl 1-numbers: "" or Addition

#### Theory


#### Game
